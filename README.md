# PDF Splitter

This is a Next.js application that allows you to split PDF files based on two methods:

1.  **By Page Count:** Split a PDF into multiple files, each containing a specified number of pages.
2.  **By Delimiter:** Split a PDF by providing a text delimiter. The application will scan the document and create a new file every time it encounters the specified text.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply upload your PDF file and choose your preferred splitting method.

This project was built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
